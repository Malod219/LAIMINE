# LAIMINE
Hi. This is a minecraft bot designed for automating boring things. So I can watch more Anime n' Youtube vids instead of playing games rofl
# Execution
You need to install a few packages first.
npm install mineflayer
npm install mineflayer-navigate
npm install blockfinder
That's all you will need to execute this. Once done, open commandline, go to directory where this script is stored and do node Lai.js

# Contribution
Feel free to contribute, but please put it in seperate scripts.
