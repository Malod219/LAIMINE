# LAIMINE
Hi. This is a Minecraft bot designed for a gamemode called MineZ. It doesn't function in many areas due to the relative complexity of MineZ compared to Minecraft.

# Execution
You need to install a few packages first.
`npm install mineflayer`
`npm install mineflayer-navigate`
`npm install blockfinder`
That's all you will need to execute this. Once done, open commandline, go to directory where this script is stored and do `node Lai.js`
